# MKVToolNix Batch Processor

A bash script for batch processing video files (MP4, MKV, WebM) using MKVToolNix.

The script will require an options file generated by MKVToolNix placed in the media source directory.
It will then apply all options to each video file located in the directory and remove metadata written by MKVToolNix, namely "title", "date", "muxing-application" and "writing-application".
The processed MKV files will be placed in a sub directory called "mkv_output". The source files remain unchanged.

## Dependencies

The following tools must be installed and available in your PATH:

- **mkvmerge** and **mkvpropedit** as part of MKVToolNix
- **jq** - Command-line JSON processor

## Usage

First, use the MKVToolNix GUI to configure your desired options:

1. Open MKVToolNix GUI
2. Add a sample video file
3. Set options like language, track name, track order, etc. Avoid options that vary between files.
4. Go to **Multiplexer → Show command line**
5. Save the options to a JSON file in the same directory as your video files

You can then run the script from your terminal:

```bash
./mkvtoolnix-batch.sh options.json
```

## Note

This script was created for macOS runing Bash 5.3 and may behave differently on Linux or older Bash versions.
